# Assignment-2
 
Details regarding question 1:

1)regarding inputs:
	a.Enter the tolerable error = (enter the tolerable error for which the difference between the theta values has to be greater)
	b.enter the maximum number of iterations = (enter the maximum no of iterations for which the gradient descent algorithm must run)
	c.Enter the learning rate = (enter the value of eta)
	d.Enter the seed value = (enter the value of eta_dash)

2) The outputs of each program are as follows:
	a. Implementaion of batch gradient descent you can observe the theta values and error In the terminal.
	b. Implementaion of batch gradient descent by using adaptive Learning rate. Theta values and error in terminal
	c. Plotting of the hypothesis equation learnt by the algorithm.
	d. Plotting of 3-dimentional mesh of the error function using theta0 and theta1 as the x and y axes and the error function as z axis.
	e. Plotting of the contour plot of the error function.
	f. Plotting of the contour plot of the error function for different learning rates.(Change in the eta to be done).

3) all the plots are visible in both plot console and normal console

!!! Note !!! 
Kindly Update the directory of the linearX.csv and linearY.csv file in the python script before running.

Details regarding question 2:

1)regarding inputs:
	a.Enter the batch size = (enter the batch size for Stochastic Gradient Descent Batch)
	
2)The outputs of each programs are as follows:
	a.PGM1->Generation of one million sample data points of various normal distribution
	b.PGM2->Implementation of stochastic gradient method on the normal distribution and predicting hypothesis according to the batch size
	c.PGM3->Error calculation of predicted hypothesis and difference between predicted and original hypothesis
	d.PGM4->Plotting the movement of theta in 3dimensional space
	
!!! Note !!! 
To run PGM4, change the following settings in spyder: Preferences->ipython console->Graphics->automatic
To check the graph of different batch sizes, change the name of file accordingly
